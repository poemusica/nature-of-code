// Consider a simulation of paint splatter drawn as a collection of colored dots. 
// Most of the paint clusters around a central location, but some dots do splatter out towards the edges.
// Can you use a normal distribution of random numbers to generate the locations of the dots?
// Can you also use a normal distribution of random numbers to generate a color palette?
